  abstract  = {Image description datasets, such as Flickr30K and MS COCO, show a high degree of variation in the ways that crowd-workers talk about the world. Although this gives us a rich and diverse collection of data to work with, it also introduces uncertainty about how the world should be described. This paper shows the extent of this uncertainty in the PEOPLE-domain. We present a taxonomy of different ways to talk about other people. This taxonomy serves as a reference point to think about how other people should be described, and can be used to classify and compute statistics about labels applied to people.},

	Abstract = {Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated on large
	image description datasets. Recently, researchers have started to collect such
	datasets for languages other than English. An unexplored question is how
	different these datasets are from English and, if there are any differences,
	what causes them to differ. This paper provides a cross-linguistic comparison
	of Dutch, English, and German image descriptions. We find that these
	descriptions are similar in many respects, but the familiarity of crowd workers
	with the subjects of the images has a noticeable influence on the specificity
	of the descriptions.},
